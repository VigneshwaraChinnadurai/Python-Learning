Test the law of large nuumbers (LLN) for N random normally distributed nmbers with mean=0 and std.dev=1.

create a python script that will couunt how many of these numbers fall between -1 and 1 and divide by total quantity of N.

You know that E(X)=68.2%

Check that mean (Xn)-> E(X) as yu rerun your script while increasing N.
