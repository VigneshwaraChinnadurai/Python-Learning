The world bank was very impressed with your deliverables on the previous assignment and they have a new project for you.

You are required to produce a scatterplot depicting Life Expectancy (y-axis) and Fertility Rate (x-axis) statistics by Country.

The scatterplot need to be categorised by Countries Regions.

You have been supplied with data for 2 years: 1960 and 2013 and you are requires to produce a visualisation for each of these years.

Some data has been provided in a CSV file, some in Python lists. The CSV file contains combined data for both years. All data manipulations have to
be performed in Python (not in Excel) because this project can be audited at the later stage.

You also have been requested to provide insights into how the two periodscompare.
